The .NET and TypeScript developer room discusses the C#, F# and TypeScript languages,
their runtime, ecosystem.

We will discuss how we evolve languages, runtimes and libraries to solve modern problems,
how you can use these platforms and how to contribute or participate in these communities.

TypeScript is a language that provides strong-typing on top of Javascript and is designed
to help build large systems and ease maintenance and joy for developers, C# is the venerable
language that was introduced with .NET and F# is a language in the OCaml family that is
the functional platform for .NET developers.

.NET and Javascript are now available on every imaginable corner and platform of the world,
and we hope to exchange ideas of usage, idioms, and programming patterns that are useful
in those different environments.
